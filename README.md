# 3DMP

This *mock* repo is used as an example for the 3D Modeling and Printing course, held at Universty of Bucharest.
The idea is to find in the student's repo all the resources and the projects he or she has been working on. 

In this general readme you should include a roadmap of the entire repo, details on each folder and what they contain.

Students should have a folder for each major project and a separate folder for the smaller "How To"s, such as the Isometric exercises.

Each folder should contain the following:
- readme with details on the specific project(s)
- the Fusion360 files (.f3d)
- stl files with all the printable components (.stl)
- pictures of the model(s) (.png)
